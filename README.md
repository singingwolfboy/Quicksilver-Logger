Quicksilver Logger Module
=========================

A very simple module for personal logging/journaling. Use case:

* Install module, configure log file location
* Finish task at work (I should log this!)
* Invoke Quicksilver, use action "Log"
* Write quick log statement ("Added foo widget to main class")
* Hit enter. Quicksilver appends your statement to the log file, along with
  a timestamp

Super easy logging for managing what you've done when you're on the clock.
